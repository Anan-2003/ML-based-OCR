#Problem Statement - ML-based OCR
##Introduction
In this project, we aim to develop an image classification model using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to accurately classify images into different categories based on their content.

##Dataset
We will be using a carefully curated dataset of 1000 images containing 5 different characters in each image. Each image is associated with a corresponding label indicating the alphabet present in the image.

##Approach
Our approach involves training and evaluating multiple machine learning algorithms on the image dataset. We will explore various models, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), support vector machines (SVM), random forests, XGBoost, and MLP classifiers. Each algorithm will be optimized to achieve the highest possible accuracy.
